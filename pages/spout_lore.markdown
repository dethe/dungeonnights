### Places

* Kalika - the capitol city of this land
* Orintheldir Manor - Genesa's family home, now a fixer-upper.
* Skagway - Gateway to the sea. There are extensive tunnels and catacombs underneath Skagway are three times as big as the city. Known entrances to the tunnels in the city are guarded, but others lead to the sea and are used by pirates and smugglers. Skagway is ruled by a Drow gang that controls several cities, the leader of this gang is a powerful Drow. Clovis has had a premonition of this guy. The Dead Minstrel died in Skagway. In the current campaign Skagway is a shadow of its former self, more of a ghost town.
* Whitrun Where the party's adventures began.
* Weaseling - Mysterious new town - Heavily armed, filled with soldiers. Claims to be at war with elves. On a fork in the road where there was no fork before. There was no town either. In the new campaign this is a vigourous town where primarily elves and orcs live in relative harmony, and one of the centres of the resistance against the Mad Queen.
* The Cozy Owlbear Inn - an inn in Skagway
