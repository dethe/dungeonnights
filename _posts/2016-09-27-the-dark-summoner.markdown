Talisa, an elven ranger, and her faithful watersphinx Mija, were tracking the daughter
of a family friend and followed a lead to the mountain where the gargoyles lived,
hoping to get some information from their leader. The gargoyles were not in a
bargaining mood and took her prisoner. The big cat escaped and has been skulking
around the edges of the caverns waiting for an opportunity to help her captive
companion.

Tsafnur was carried by the gargoyles up and along the narrow passageway until
it opened up into a large cavern. There were 12 stone columns with shackles,
mostly holding chained corpses, but one living prisoner. The columns were arranged
in a circle around a grotesquely carved altar, and the gargoyles landed by one
of the columns, unchained the corpse, and shackled Tsafnur to it. Other gargoyles
milled about in the dimly torchlit cavern, and one part of the chamber, opposite
from where Tsafnur was brought in, was mysteriously pitch black with none of the
torchlight penetrating it at all. Talisa, tied to another of the columns, watches
all this ready for any opportunity to turn her luck around.

Chameleon had followed and watched this in her bat form. The remaining gargoyle
flew past her to rejoin its comrades. She counted 12 gargoyles in the room, all
somewhat agitated, moving around the room without apparent purpose. She flew
back to the others to lead them here to mount a rescue.

Clovis and Enkirash had jumped over the crevasse to where the narrow path continued
on the other side. Enkirash almost fell, but caught the edge and when Clovis hauled
her up, her sash (which had several useful potions tied to it) caught on the rocks
and fell into the depths. Enkirash is developing a pounding headache and can feel
energy surge around her through the rocks. Somewhere nearby there is a dark
summoning ritual going on, and she thinks that if they do not stop it from being
completed, things will go very badly for them. There is a natural river of energy
flowing through here, and it is being turned to some very nasty purpose.

When Chameleon finds her friends, she leads them up the steep cliffs by turning into
a large fruit bat and carrying the end of a rope up, then resuming her human form
and tying it off securely, then repeating when her companions have climbed up.
They begin to notice that her face doesn't change back to her own face after each
transformation, it is like she comes back as someone else, but only for a few moments
before her own face gradually re-emerges. She has become irritable and snappy with
them as well, and she can feel that something from the gems she carries is changing
her.

On the last of these climbing stretches, four gargoyles that were lying in wait,
hidden in the stone, emerged to attack Clovis and Enkirash as they climbed. Chameleon
threw her spear at them, but only managed to lose it into the chasm. Two
of them tore Enkirash away and flew off with her, while the remaining two attacked
Clovis and the rope she was clinging on to. Clovis took a nasty clawing as she
dangled on the rope trying to get a good swing in with her axe, but after some
time the two gargoyles perked their ears as if they'd heard something and then
flew off.

Back in the cavern, Tsafnur recognizes some of the imagery on the altar from a song
he heard long ago from The Dead Minstrel, who himself was cursed to be undying,
although still aging, just bones and skin when Tsafnur knew him. He played a bone
flute and taught a younger Tsafnur the songs and stories of the ancient horror
Arakgnash, both dragon and lich, feared for centuries although fortunately no longer
troubling the earth. Or so the songs said.
