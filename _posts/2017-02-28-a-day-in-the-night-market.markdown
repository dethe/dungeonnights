In the Night Market in the extensive catacombs beneath Skagway, Chameleon, Clovis,
and Talisa have gone off on their own explorations, leaving Tsafnur, Enkirash, and
Rook (and Mija the Water Sphinx) to their own devices. Rook bought some wrist
sheath knives for Talisa, then she and Tsafnur bought a busking license and put
on a show of fireworks and music, playing requests for a coin (some paid more than
one coin for more elaborate requests). This kept them busy all day and into the
evening (as well as time can be tracked deep underground), but they made 240 coins
in the process.

Rook took Mija to get her a nice collar and then went looking for the inner market,
as they had heard that the area they'd been exploring in was only the outskirts and
overflow of the real Night Market. She looked for someone who might be heading into
the deeper market to follow and was startled and terrified to recognize a figure
straight out of Dwarf (and Halfling) mythology stomping through the market. It was
Grumblesticks, stealer of Dwarf children, and she had a captive Dwarf child in tow on
a leash. She carried her bloody spiked club and stomped by in her iron boots, and
Rook bravely followed her.

They passed the Lich Sorceress, in her purplish amoeba-like cloak, who whispered
offers to bring back the dead, restore lost limbs, or purchase secrets. Then through
a curtain of chains, Rook followed the horror she'd thought was only a legend, into
the slave market. Glad that she had Mija with her, they saw the sow-headed monster
settle into a chair in the bidding pit, where an Ogre, three young Dwarfs, an elvish
woman, and two male elves were about to be sold. Rook noticed that Mija became very
alert when they saw the slaves for auction, but wasn't able to tell quite why.

Rook tried to bid for the Dwarf children, but didn't have enough money to outbid
Grumblesticks. She bid for the elf woman against some sketchy magickal types who
were arguing amongst themselves to one side. The woman was announced as being from
a local family of nobles, and Rook suspected it was Genesa, who Talisa has been
trying to find all this time. After a few bids, the magickal rejects ended up
fighting between each other, gave up bidding and left. As Rook's hopes of winning
the bid went up, a well-dressed, confident, relaxed woman behind her began bidding
for the elf woman. She smiled and nodded at Rook when she turned to see who it was.
After a couple of more bids, Mija growled and Rook jumped when she saw the woman
sitting in the chair next to her. She said something to the effect of, "Good afternoon,
Market etiquette prevents me from asking why you are bidding for this slave, but
rest assured that my intentions for her will be highly profitable and I can easily
outbid you." She paused to let this sink in, then lowered her voice, "From your
appearance, I take it that you are someone of negotiable services." Rook nodded.
"Then I can let you win the bidding, in exchange for a service you will provide me,
agreed?" Rook agreed and bid. A burly man began to bid, but a glance from the woman
next to Rook changed his mind, leaving Rook the only bidder. The woman introduced
herself as Madame Obelis, and requested the Rook come to her premises later that
day. Rook took the chained elf and they and Mija got out of the slave market. During
the whole bidding process a well-dressed elvish gentleman watch the proceedings
closely, noting Rook and Obelis talking.

At first, the woman refused to give her name, saying it didn't matter. She looked
crushed, despondent, exhausted, and starving. Rook took her back to the others and got
them some food. After eating, the rescued elf fell asleep. When Rook woke her up, she
called her by name, "Genesa, wake up." She woke, then realized where she was and asked,
"What are you going to do with me?" Rook explained that Talisa had been trying to find
her, to return her to her family. Genesa, looking scared, asked, "my uncle?" Rook said,
"No, your father," and Genesa started crying. It turns out her uncle was the well-dressed
elf watching the bidding, who had kidnapped her and sold her into slavery, and who is
plotting against her father. She wants to leave right away to warn her father, but
Rook tells her they have to finish something first, and Genessa certainly doesn't want to travel
alone. At the end of the day,
when Enkirash and Tsafnur had finished their various commissions, they found a room
to rent, stashed the sleepy elf in it, and left Mija to guard her while they went
out to find Madame Obelis. On the way they pass a booth of

They find Madame Obelis' Emporium, a bar and lounge filled with many scantily clad
humanoids of many races and genders. Most, but not all, wear slave collars. The place
is busy with many customers. Rook, after some back and forth with an Ogre bouncer, gets
him to tell Obelis they have arrived. He goes upstairs to check with his boss, then
sends them up. They go to the door, which is opened by another Ogre, one of two
bodyguards in the room. Madame Obelis sits behind an immense mahogany desk, in a richly
appointed room of bookshelves, paintings, carpets, and many dim lamps. Rook scans the
room to note that several of the bookshelves are hinged, there are hiding places behind
several paintings, and a trap door under the carpet they are standing on. They move
off the trap door, which Obelis notes with approval.

She discusses the terms of their arrangement. The sketchy magickal types call themselves
the Thaumaturgy Crew, and it has come to her attention that their leader, Winston, is
trying to summon a demon. This could be very bad for business, and she wants Rook
to prevent this from happening, and to bring proof that she has done so.

> And Rook levelled up to level 3.
