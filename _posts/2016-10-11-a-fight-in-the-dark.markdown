> We spent some time at the beginning of the session finishing up from last session,
> then we picked up right at the beginning of what appears to be two boss fights in one.

In the hallway, Talisa, an elven ranger and Tsafnur the bard have been separated from
their friends by a deep, spike-filled pit. Their only light comes from Chameleon the
Druid, who has shapeshifted into the form of a giant firefly. The light from Chameleon
pulses on and off, from pitch darkness to dim light and with each pulse of light they
can see giant poisonous centipedes climbing up the walls of the pit at them, with each
pulse, the vile creatures get closer.

Meanwhile, across the pit, down the hall, and in what appears to be the bedchamber
of Hurbekt, the dark summoner they defeated last session are Clovis the barbarian and
Enkirash the wizard. Piles of loot lie tantalizingly
close, but between them and the treasure, a giant six-armed gargoyle has risen up from
the floor to block their way. It makes a horrific grinding sound, which may be its
form of a war-cry, but Clovis doesn't way for it to strike. The dwarven barbarian swings
her axe at the monster's knee, but it glances off the stone and the gargoyle places one
on her chest and shoves her out of the room and sends her sliding down the hallway towards
the pit of spikes.

On the other side of the pit, Talisa leaned over the pit to shoot an arrow into one of
the oncoming centipedes, skewering it, but fails to see another coming up in the shadow,
which bites her ankle, sending poison burning into her leg. Tsafnur stabs at one of the
beasts with his rapier, hurting it and knocking its front feet off the wall, so it's body
is twisting and turning, trying to get all its feet back on the wall. While they are
in the thick of it, they see Clovis slide into the pool of light cast by Chameleon,
and just barely miss grabbing the edge of the pit, sliding down into the darkness.

Clovis slides close to the edge of the pit, missing the spikes. At the bottom she
wastes no time, grabbing two of the spear-like spike, ripping them out of their
sockets, and stabbing one centipede to a pulp with them. Talisa shoots the centipede
that bit her, and focussing through the pain of the poison spreading up her leg, manages
to pick off one more.

Back in the bedchamber, Enkirash doused her glowing staff and cowered in the corner,
trying to hide from the giant stone creature. It continues to make the grinding
sounds, like tortured stones squealing in pain. She piles some rocks on her unseen
servant, which whisks them over to the gargoyle and the sound abates for a little
while, replaced by an ominous crunching.

During the respite, Enkirash summons a spirit and asks it three questions. [What where the questions?]

As the grinding resumes, the wizard has
collected herself enough to recognize that the beast is trying to use human speech,
and that the horrid grinding sound is it begging, "free me!" She lights her staff
again, and sees the gargoyle was feeling around in the dark trying to find her. In
the renewed light, it straightens back up (it has to duck a little, being taller
than the ceiling), but makes no move to harm her. It repeats the grinding words,
"free me!"

Having dispatched the centipedes, and with the poison in Talisa's leg having run its
course, leaving her leg swollen and painful, but not life threatening, they use
Clovis dwarven rope, woven from the fine silken hairs of maiden dwarves first beards,
to swing across the pit and hurry to help Enkirash. She explains to them that the
gargoyle means them no harm, but it is bound here to protect the treasure and if they
want to get to the loot they will first have to free the gargoyle.

She cuts her hair and sends it, via unseen servant, to the gargoyle to eat, binding them
together for the ritual. Sadly, her ritual was too rushed and fails to free the gargoyle
from it's slavery. Tsafnur steps up, unable to play his fiddle since the loss of his
hand, but still able to sing. He sings a song of unbinding and the enchantment holding
the gargoyle is broken, with the snap of a bracelet. Unfortunately, with so many sources
of magic in the room, the unbinding worked too well, and several other items were made
unstable as a result.

The giant gargoyle wasted no time on thanks, but left the room at speed, passing Mija,
Talisa's water sphinx, in the hall and getting hissed at in passing.

The party spends what they guess is a night in the chamber and before they leave, each chose
what they wanted to carry back from the loot.

* Finding an easier way back to the mushroom village
* Two pathways, one smooth and slanting down, the other uneven and treacherous
    * Obvious trap is obvious and also a trap
    * Chameleon explores as bat, finds turkey avengers
    * Party takes other path, find submerged boat
    * Following the stream downstream, encounter mushroom people fleeing village
    * Return mushroom idol, get rewards
* No cliffhanger tonight
