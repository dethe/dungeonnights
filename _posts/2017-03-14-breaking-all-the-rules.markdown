Clovis showed up with a cute leather-clad (but not much leather) Drow boy on a leash,
who had wanted to be Dom'd by a Dwarf. His name is Francis and he is excited about
their adventures.

The party had to choose whether to return Genesa to her father, try to take on
Grumblesticks to rescue the Dwarf children, or stop the Thaumaturgy Crew from summoning
a demon. They decided to go after the Crew first, left Genesa back at the "hotel"
with Mija to guard her and went looking for clues. They found a thaumaturgy supply
store, but didn't get any useful information from the proprietor. On a hunch
they searched for cheap diners nearby and found a meat pie diner ("All pies at
least 50% genuine meat"). Inside they found the Crew packed into a booth that was
too small for them. Tsafnur (with Clovis and Rook as backup singers) sang them a
song about the dangers of demon summoning. Then they refused to leave until they
got a tip. Winston, leader of the Crew, grabbed one of the others and dug a coin
out of her pocket, threw it at Tsafnur and growled at them (through the mask that
he wears to breath alchemical fumes) to get out of there.

Clovis jumped on a table and grabbed the same Crew member and took a heat ray to
the back, while another Crew member (Toro) also jumped on the table with superhuman
speed. Rook snuck under the table and almost managed to steal a book from under Winston's
clothes, when he caught her wrists. But he let go when Tsafnur cut the tube from his
mask, releasing the alchemical fumes, so he could grab it and hold his mask together.
Our intrepid heroes ran, and got out the door despite furniture turning over in
their path and a couple of stray heat rays (one caught Francis and one made Clovis'
shiny helmet distinctly un-shiny).

Toro followed them out, staying on Clovis' tail as the three took off in different
directions, Clovis now carrying the wounded Francis. Rook doubled back and backstabbed
Toro with a throwing dagger, staggering her. Toro had a vision that Clovis was
already dead and wandered off as if nothing had happened.

Rook took the book to Madame Obelis, who discharged her debt of favour. On her way
there, running with the book (which she had not yet confirmed was the guide to
demon summoning, or even looked at), she passed the Lich Sorceress, who challenged
her and made her justify her actions to her as an Enforcer of Market Law. While
the party clearly broke Market Law, the Lich decided that the cause was worthy and
gave Rook a warning to take it outside the market next time, but pardoning her
for this infringement, with the caveat that there won't be a second pardon.

Meanwhile, Tsafnur returned
to the "hotel" to gather up Genesa and Mija and leave a note for the others if they
should return. Clovis took Francis back to the Drow club she found him in and then
went to the soup stall where they had all agreed to meet to leave a note for the
others. Then they all met up near where Asterion had first led them out of the labyrinth
near the Night Market.

From there they began trying to find their way back to the surface, choosing
passageways that looked well-used and led generally up. Ahead they could see
torchlight, which soon turned out to be an Elf nobleman holding a torch. Rook
and Genesa recognized him as Genesa's uncle. Genesa wanted to run away, but Mija
and Tsafnur convinced her to remain calm(-ish). Clovis bellowed a challenge to
the Elf and began to charge, when two lizardmen step up beside him and Clovis's
arms were seized from either side by unseen hands. The lizardmen charged with their
spears, while the uncle strolled arrogantly toward her, but they were still too
far away to see clearly when Clovis wrenched the chameleon women holding her from their
feet and smashed them together hard enough to knock them both unconscious.

Clovis charged the lizardmen with a knife in one hand and her axe in the other,
while Rook quietly killed the helpless chameleon women. Clovis batted the spears
away with minimal damage and killed both lizardmen with her first blow. The uncle
was looking around for the lizardwomen, saying to the darkness, "We had a deal."
Rook stood on top of one of the lizard women to show that they were dead, and he
paled and ran. Rook shot him in the back, killing him. They looted the bodies,
and continued on the path, hoping to get out of the catacombs.
